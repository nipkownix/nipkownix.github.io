I"<p>A project designed to fix and tweak the â€œUHDâ€ port of Resident Evil 4 on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/254700/Resident_Evil_4/">Steam</a>.</p>

<h3 id="current-features">Current features</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Increase FOV</strong> - Increases the default FOV. Useful to prevent motion sickness in some people.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Fix sniper zoom</strong> - When playing with keyboard and mouse, this fixes an annoying bug which would cause your camera to be off-center after you zoomed in with a sniper rifle.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Restore pickup screen transparency</strong> - Restores a transparency effect that was present on the GameCube and Wii versions of RE4, but has been missing since the game was ported to Xbox 360.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Disable post processing</strong> - Disables post processing effects such as motion blur and the â€œcolor filterâ€ option. Most notably, it disables the gameâ€™s forced FXAA, making the image much sharper and clearer. 
The anti-aliasing option found in the settings menu is unaffected.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Disable film grain</strong> - Disables the film grain overlay that is present in most sections of the game.</p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Flip items in your inventory using the keyboard</strong> - Creates key bindings to flip (not just rotate) items when playing with a keyboard and mouse, just like you can do if you play with a controller.
    <ul>
      <li>Default bindings:
        <ul>
          <li>Flip up: Home</li>
          <li>Flip down: End</li>
          <li>Flip left: Insert</li>
          <li>Flip right: Page Up</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Rebind keyboard QTE keys</strong> - The vanilla game doesnâ€™t allow the user to change the main QTE keys, being â€œXâ€ and â€œCâ€. Changing them via an .ini file is possible, but the on screen prompts donâ€™t change to match the new keys, leading to confusion. This mod changes the default QTE keys to be â€œAâ€ and â€œDâ€, both customizable and with proper on screen prompt support.</li>
</ul>

I".%<p>Chaotic;Head is a Chaos;Head patch created to improve its stability and playability.</p>

<p>Chaos;Head is a visual novel developed by 5pb. and Nitroplus, but unlike its more popular “cousin” Steins;Gate, Chaos;Head was never localized. Fans took it upon themselves to translate the whole game unofficially, but they couldn’t predict just how terrible the game’s engine was. “N2System” as it is called, is both amazing and terrible at the same time. It is capable of performing some very interesting functions, considering it is a somewhat old VN engine. However, despite the efforts of many dedicated people releasing multiple patches over the years, the fan-made localization of Chaos;Head was never really considered “perfect”.</p>

<p>I discovered this game after reading Steins;Gate and got hooked immediately. But quite early on I faced issues, ranging from videos not playing to entire characters straight up being invisible. Not to mention it was impossible to play on Linux due to its flawed and old DRM.</p>

<p>While investigating, I found a newer build of that engine, used in another game called “Zanma Taisei Demonbane”. Unlike Chaos;Head, Demonbane was localized and officially released in the US, meaning this build of the engine would run out of the box, without the need to switch your compute to a Japanese locale or use a locale emulator. Luckily, N2System compiles its scripts at runtime, meaning I had everything I needed to port Chaos;Head from its official 2008 Japanese version of the engine, to a 2011 English version build. After many hours of swimming through Japanese code, the result was a much more reliable way to play Chaos;Head in English.</p>

<p>Thanks to the help I received from DVN, this project not only included technical fixes, but also grammatical and translation improvements as well.</p>

<p>List of Chaotic;Head improvements:</p>

<ul>
  <li>No need to use locale emulator;</li>
  <li>Fixed broken video playback;</li>
  <li>Di-Patch improvements included;</li>
  <li>New title cards;</li>
  <li>Multiple font options;</li>
  <li>Working LCS (underwear mode);</li>
  <li>Translation fixes;</li>
  <li>Runs on Linux (using Wine)</li>
</ul>

<p>The game runs out of the box on Linux using Wine. The only issue is that videos will not play without installing <a href="https://github.com/Nevcairiel/LAVFilters">LAV Filters</a>.</p>

<p>The installer works with both original Japanese versions: “Retail with LCS installed” or “DMM The Best”</p>

<p>HUGE thanks to the folks who made the awesome Di-Patch,
the people at TLWiki and everyone else who contribuited to improve and make Chaos;Head acessible to everyone.</p>

  <li>Fixed a few instances where looking at the backlog after voiced lines would crash the game.</li>
  <li>Fixed some voices playing twice at the same time.</li>
  <li>Restored an animated event that was only present in the LCS patch.</li>
  <li>Out of two similar and mixed-up CGs, swapped them and added one’s translation to the other.</li>
  <li>Changed the game’s year back to 2008, to match the voice-line and the original/Noah’s script.</li>

</ul>

<hr />

<p>1.21:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The “Auto/Skip mode stops at decision points” option was reverted to also apply to YES/NO decisions, as it did in the original.</li>
  <li>The closing dialog should now adhere correctly to whether you are in a menu or not.</li>
  <li>Removed text pauses before text ends, as the engine does take them into consideration now.</li>
  <li>Replaced FES’ song seeking method with the one from the LCS patch, fixing the seek and preventing crashes. Also applied a fix for the new engine.</li>
  <li>Re-added the static screen that plays after the Start button is pressed.</li>
  <li>Removed sound from videos that don’t need them, as the new engine plays them alongside in-game audio.</li>
  <li>Restored a missing line from 01_006.</li>
  <li>Zooms on the chatbox should now focus on the correct text.</li>
  <li>Restored a missing section at 09_198.</li>
  <li>Fixed 01_003 requiring two clicks to get through.</li>
  <li>Moved 03_057’s video translation lower, and made it appear instantly, with the original 3-second delay to make it easier to read.</li>
  <li>Reverted the miscellaneous textbox functions to be more encapsulated, hopefully also fixing unnecessary text cursors.</li>
  <li>Changed @chan’s line breaks, allowing the website’s banner to be seen every time.</li>
  <li>Fixed the “Cut voices off” checkbox appearing in the wrong place.</li>
  <li>Increased the backlog’s character per line count. Originally was 30. The EXE was patched to a maximum of 90 from 32 and the game was set to 70. Also lowered the font size, reverted max rows to 17 from 16 and row intervals from 34 to 29, and moved the text back a bit.</li>
  <li>Fixed wrong picture for the 8th picture on the third page of the extra gallery. (It was even in the pre-LCS game)</li>
  <li>Removed Ampersands from functions that print directly to the backlog.</li>

</ul>

<hr />

<p>Compared to Di-Patch (from Di-Patch 2.5 to Chaotic;Head 1.20):</p>

  <li>Revised line formatting to make up for the lack of word-wrapping.</li>
  <li>Changed Japanese video names to English ones. (This, alongside the new engine, should remove the need for Japanese locale)</li>
